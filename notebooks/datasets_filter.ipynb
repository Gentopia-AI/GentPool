While it might be impossible for one, it could still be possible for another. In a word, everything is possible. Someone once said, \"Success belongs to those who can look at challenges offered by the world as an inspiration.\" So your challenges are golden opportunities for success. How can there be wonders if there are no difficulties? You need challenges to show your ability and success comes from the problems you face. Those who refuse to give in come out smiling. Robert X. Perez once said, \"The seeds of success spring from failure\\'s ashes; failure is not defeat and it just directs you in the right direction. To fail is to understand what you should not do. Remember it and don\\'t give up until your goal is achieved.\" What should you do when you face difficulties? Jasbeen says, \"Yeah, life is difficult, but you shouldn\\'t give up. You should have a positive and calm attitude towards all your difficulties and make the best of them. You may learn something new. You can accept failure and develop mental toughness. Mental toughness is to see the long-term pains rather than be put off by short-term pains. Once you have this toughness, you have an advantage of winning.\" The only thing in life you ever really regret is the chances you didn\\'t take. You will only regret when you are faced with the consequences of not taking chances and seizing the moment. Take every chance you can! Everything you\\'ve done in life may be good or bad, but no matter what you may do, you must try your best. You must do something meaningful and do it right now.
