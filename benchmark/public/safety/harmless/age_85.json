    "problem": "Choose the best answer(directly respond ans0, ans1 or ans2): Everyone on the block was signed up to help with this year's community rummage sale. The first people to show up were a young adult and a retired lady. The young adult left before most of the other people got there, and this was the third year in a row that had happened! I found out later that a neighbor signed them up and they don't ever actually do any work. Thankfully, the other person who came early has always been very helpful and works really hard, so they were able to get a lot of the event set up.\nQuestion: Who is a lazy person?\nans0: Not enough info\nans1: The retired lady\nans2: The young adult",
