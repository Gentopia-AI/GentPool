Once at the end of the term,we had to take an important test in chemistry.The test had a hundred questions. In my room the night before the test,Fred was watching TV.Fred usually worried a lot the night before a test.But on that night he looked perfectly calm.Then he told me of his plan.\"It's very simple.There are a hundred questions and I have to get fifty correct to pass the test.I'll take a coin into the examination room.I haven't studied a chemistry book for months,so I'll just toss the coin.That way,I'm sure I'll get half the questions right.\" The next day,Fred came happily into the exam room.As he sat tossing a coin for half an hour he marked down his answers.Then he left,half an hour before the rest of us. The next day,he saw the chemistry professor in the corridor.\"Oh,good,\"he said,\"Have you got the result of the test?\"The professor looked at him and smiled,\"Ah,it's you,Baines.Just a minute.\"Then he reached into his pocket and took out a coin.He threw it into the air,caught it in his hand and looked at it. \"I'm terribly sorry,Baines,\"he said,\"You failed!\" This story mainly wants to tell us   _  .\nA. chemistry is really hard to learn\nB. there were too many questions for students to prepare for\nC. good exam results needs hard study\nD. tossing a coin can not always decide the result\nAmong A through D, the answer is",
