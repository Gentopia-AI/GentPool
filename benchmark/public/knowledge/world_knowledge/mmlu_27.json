    "problem": "The Price of a Dream I grew up poor. We had little money, but plenty of love and attention. I understood that no matter how poor a person was, they could still afford a dream.

He not only believed in me, but taught me the difference between having a dream and showing conviction . One summer a friend recommended me for a summer job.

I devoted myself to sports that summer, and within the year I was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates to play rookie-league ball, and offered a $20,000 contract. I signed with the Denver Broncos in 1984 for $1.7 million, and bought my mother the house of my dream.
