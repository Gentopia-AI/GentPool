        "problem": "Let's face the facts. On most occasions, some things may seem impossible, but in every impossibility, there is possibility. Impossible situations don't last forever. While it might be impossible for one, it could still be possible for another. In a word, everything is possible. Someone once said, \"Success belongs to those who can look at challenges offered by the world as an inspiration.\" So your challenges are golden opportunities for success. How can there be wonders if there are no difficulties? You need challenges to show your ability and success comes from the problems you face. Those who refuse to give in come out smiling. Robert X. Perez once said, \"The seeds of success spring from failure's ashes; failure is not defeat and it just directs you in the right direction. To fail is to understand what you should not do. Remember it and don't give up until your goal is achieved.\" What should you do when you face difficulties? Jasbeen says, \"Yeah, life is difficult, but you shouldn't give up. You should have a positive and calm attitude towards all your difficulties and make the best of them. You may learn something new. You can accept failure and develop mental toughness. Mental toughness is to see the long-term pains rather than be put off by short-term pains. Once you have this toughness, you have an advantage of winning.\" The only thing in life you ever really regret is the chances you didn't take. You will only regret when you are faced with the consequences of not taking chances and seizing the moment. Take every chance you can! Everything you've done in life may be good or bad, but no matter what you may do, you must try your best. You must do something meaningful and do it right now. The passage is mainly about   _  .\nA. how to face challenges\nB. how to be successful\nC. how to hold the hold the chances in life\nD. how to turn impossibilities into possibilities\nAmong A through D, the answer is",

        "problem": "Katie was in big trouble. She was such a sweet kid; a third-grade teacher always dreamed of having a classroom filled with Katies; she was never ever a discipline  problem. I just couldn't imagine why she had made her parents so angry. It seemed that Katie had been running up sizable charges in the lunchroom. Her parents explained that Katie brought a great homemade lunch each day, and there was no reason for her to buy school lunch. They assumed a sit-down with Katie would solve the problem, but failed. So they asked me to help them get to the bottom of this situation. So the next day, I asked Katie to my office. \"Why are you charging lunches, Katie? What happened to your homemade lunch?\" I asked. \"I lose it,\" she responded. I leaned back in my chair and said, \"I don't believe you, Katie. \" She didn't care. \"Is someone stealing your lunch, Katie?\" I took a new track. \"No. I just lose it,\" she said. Well, there was nothing else I could do. The problem was still unsolved the next week when I noticed a boy who was new to the school sitting alone at a lunch table. He always looked sad. I thought I would go and sit with him for a while. As I walked towards him, I noticed the lunch bag on the table. The name on the bag said \"Katie\". Now I understood and I talked to Katie. It seemed that the new boy never brought a lunch, and he wouldn't go to the lunch line for a free lunch. He had told Katie his secret and asked her not to tell anyone that his parents wanted him to get a free lunch at school. Katie asked me not to tell her parents, but I drove to her house that evening after I was sure that she was in bed. I had never seen parents so proud of their child. Katie didn't care that her parents and teacher were disappointed in her. But she cared about a little boy who was hungry and scared. Katie still buys lunch every day at school. And every day, as she heads out of the door, her mom hands her a delicious homemade lunch. What did the author think of Katie?\nA. She performed well at school.\nB. She was a girl filled with love.\nC. She often made trouble at school.\nD. She used to be a discipline problem.\nAmong A through D, the answer is",

        "problem": "Should students do the grading? The Supreme Court says the practice doesn't violate  a student's right to privacy, but is it right for students to grade one another? Walter Potenza, California The Supreme Court was absolutely correct to say it's OK for students to grade one another's homework, quizzes, and tests: in fact, it's a great idea. By grading one another's papers and seeing the problems their classmates have, students double their exposure  to the troubles that they may meet on future exams and tests. Grading one another's papers may be one of the best ways for students to _ within themselves the ways to master the most difficult parts of what they are learning. Teachers are underappreciated and underpaid for the number of hours they have to work to be able to teach really well. Grading all their students' papers can take hours. Some of that time and energy can be saved by spending a few minutes in class, while providing an extremely valuable learning experience. I understand that some individuals are sensitive to their classmates seeing their work or grades. Any good teacher would be considerate of students who don't want their classmates to grade their assignments. Winston Smith, North Carolina A girl moves back as her classmate announces her failing test grade and hands her the paper. The quiet classroom heats up. With the increase in student grading over the past few years, scenes like this have become a bitter reality in schools across the nation. Teachers and schools should not advocate student grading and public announcement of grades because it provides a violation of privacy for students and causes unfair judgments and treatment by their classmates. Since 1974, a law known as the Buckley Amendment has forbidden the release of education records in order to protect the privacy of students and their families. I strongly disagree with the Court's ruling that this law does not include student grading. I can think of no greater violation of privacy than the exposure of one's personal information to a group of peers . This can be very embarrassing. Releasing this sort of personal information should be avoided, especially by institutions that seek to provide a supportive environment during essential years of human development. Walter Potenza suggests that   _  .\nA. teachers should set aside some time to grade students' papers\nB. the Supreme Court should do more research on students grading\nC. teachers should guide students on how to grade homework\nD. teachers should be careful not to hurt those sensitive students\nAmong A through D, the answer is",

        "problem": "It remained a question who had to be the pioneer life on a new island. In fact, few people knew it.     Thousands of years ago, in the middle of an ocean, miles from the nearest island, an undersea volcano  broke out. The hot liquid rock piled higher and higher and spread wider and wider. In this way, an island rose up in the sea.     As time went on, hot sun and cool rains made the rock split and break into pieces. Sea waves dashed against the rock. In this way, soil and sand came into being.     It is well known that nothing lived on the naked soil. And then the wind and the birds brought plant seeds, spiders and other creatures there. Only plants could grow first. Only they, in sunlight, could produce food from the minerals of the soil, water and air. While many animals landed on the island, they could find no food. A spider spun its web in vain , because there were no insects for its web to catch. Insects could not stay until there were plants for them to eat. So plants had to be the pioneer life on his new island.
