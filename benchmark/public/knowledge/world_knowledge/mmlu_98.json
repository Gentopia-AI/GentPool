    "problem": "While you may think that being smart and talented would logically make someone successful in running a business, unfortunately, this is often not the case. This problem starts back in school when the stressful \"group projects\" are first assigned .The smartest don't want to risk their grade in the class by dividing the work equally and hoping that an average student does his part well. They just take over and do the whole project themselves. And thus begins the smart-people work cycle. The smartest people do just about everything better than most everyone else until it comes to running a business. They are not better. A smart person who can't stand someone else doing a job badly does everything himself. Then, he is stuck with the one-man band \"job-business\" and ends up not being able to grow. However, it is quite interesting and strange that some \"slackers\" ( a person who is lazy and avoids work) are better suited to be a business leader than the \"smart\" people. Smart and talented people often have a gift for the unusual, complicated or different. They don't like to follow the KISS principle (keep it simple, stupid), which is required to make a business succeed. Maybe you think the global presence of McDonald's complex, but in reality, in the company, every single task is broken down into easy-to-follow steps and everything has been standardized. These successful companies have just a few smart enough people to run the majority of the tasks in a way that can't be screwed up by their average employees. So, being smart or talented isn't going to help you unless you can use those smarts to figure out a way to simplify those tasks that will make a business successful. Another issue with the smart people starting businesses is that they often have the most to lose. The smarter you are, the more options you have available to you. You will be able to make a lot of money in various fields and have room in your career to become promoted. This means that when you start a business, you have a lot more to risk than those who are not equally smart. This is often referred to as the _ dilemma. So, don't be surprised when the person \"MOST Likely to Succeed\" from high school ends up as an employee and it is one average student that finds success in his or her own business. McDonald's is used as an example to prove that   _  .\nA. a business calls for smart people's talent\nB. average employees can perform complex tasks\nC. smart people are important for a successful business\nD. simplified tasks are required for the success of a business\nAmong A through D, the answer is",
