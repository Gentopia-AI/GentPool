Reporter: What gave you the idea to make a trip around India on an elephant, Chris? Chris: Well, it all started the idea two years ago when I was planning a trip to India. I visited a photo exhibition of elephants and I realized that the only enjoyable way to make a trip around India was on an elephant. Reporter: What did you do next? Chris: I flew to New Delhi and started looking for an elephant, I needed an elephant trained to carry people. I didn't know anything about elephants, so I asked an expert  for help. He taught me how to ride an elephant. He also helped me find an elephant. Reporter: How long did it take to find a suitable elephant? Chris: Not too long. I bought a female elephant called Tara for about 6, 000 dollars. Reporter: Can you tell me about the journey? Chris: Tara and I set off from New Delhi a week later. We were going to Sonepur in northern India. There is a big elephant market there and I could sell Tara easily. And what a ride! Elephants can travel at about 6 miles an hour and Sonepur is more than 1, 200 km away. It took us 64 days to complete the journey. Reporter: Did you have any problems on your journey? Chris: Yes, a few. But nothing serious. On the third day, Tara hurt her foot. Btu that got better quickly. Also, there was a lot of heavy rain during the first week and we got very wet! Reporter: What happened when you reached Sonepur? Chris: My plan was to sell Tara. But I was very fond of her. I couldn't take her back to Britain and I didn't want to sell her at the market. I happened to meet some people who wanted an elephant for their national park in southern India. I knew that Tara would be safe with them, so I gave her to them. I was very sad to say goodbye.
