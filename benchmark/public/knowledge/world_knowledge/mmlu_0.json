    "problem": "Should students do the grading? The Supreme Court says the practice doesn't violate  a student's right to privacy, but is it right for students to grade one another? Walter Potenza, California The Supreme Court was absolutely correct to say it's OK for students to grade one another's homework, quizzes, and tests: in fact, it's a great idea. By grading one another's papers and seeing the problems their classmates have, students double their exposure  to the troubles that they may meet on future exams and tests. Grading one another's papers may be one of the best ways for students to _ within themselves the ways to master the most difficult parts of what they are learning. Teachers are underappreciated and underpaid for the number of hours they have to work to be able to teach really well. Grading all their students' papers can take hours. Some of that time and energy can be saved by spending a few minutes in class, while providing an extremely valuable learning experience. I understand that some individuals are sensitive to their classmates seeing their work or grades. Any good teacher would be considerate of students who don't want their classmates to grade their assignments. Winston Smith, North Carolina A girl moves back as her classmate announces her failing test grade and hands her the paper. The quiet classroom heats up. With the increase in student grading over the past few years, scenes like this have become a bitter reality in schools across the nation. Teachers and schools should not advocate student grading and public announcement of grades because it provides a violation of privacy for students and causes unfair judgments and treatment by their classmates. Since 1974, a law known as the Buckley Amendment has forbidden the release of education records in order to protect the privacy of students and their families. I strongly disagree with the Court's ruling that this law does not include student grading. I can think of no greater violation of privacy than the exposure of one's personal information to a group of peers . This can be very embarrassing. Releasing this sort of personal information should be avoided, especially by institutions that seek to provide a supportive environment during essential years of human development.
