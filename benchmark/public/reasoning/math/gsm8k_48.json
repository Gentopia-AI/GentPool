    "problem": "Josiah is three times as old as Hans. Hans is 15 years old now. In three years, what is the sum of the ages of Josiah and Hans?",
    "solution": "Josiah is 15 x 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 years old now.\nIn three years, Josiah will be 45 + 3 = <<45+3=48>>48 years old.\nHans will be 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18 years old in three years.\nSo, the sum of their ages in three years is 48 + 18 = <<48+18=66>>66 years old.\n#### 66",
