    "problem": "Through a point on the hypotenuse of a right triangle, lines are drawn parallel to the legs of the triangle so that the triangle is divided into a square and two smaller right triangles. The area of one of the two small right triangles is $m$ times the area of the square. What is the ratio of the area of the other small right triangle to the area of the square?  Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $m$.",
    "solution": "Without loss of generality, let the side of the square have length 1 unit and let the area of triangle $ADF$ be $m$. Let $AD=r$ and $EC=s$. Because triangles $ADF$ and $FEC$ are similar, $\\frac{s}{1}=\\frac{1}{r}$. Since $\\frac{1}{2}r=m$, the area of triangle $FEC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}s=\\frac{1}{2r}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4m}}$.
