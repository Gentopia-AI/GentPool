    "problem": "How many positive three-digit integers with each digit greater than 4 are divisible by 6?",
    "solution": "To be divisible by 6, a number must have its digits add up to a multiple of 3, and be even.  Therefore, for the hundreds place, the possible digits are $\\{5,6,7,8,9\\}$, for the tens place the possible digits also are $\\{5,6,7,8,9\\}$, and for the ones digit, you can only choose from $\\{6,8\\}$.\n\nFirst, let us choose 6 for the ones place.  The other two digits must add up to a multiple of 3, making a total of 8 pairs that satisfy that condition: $$\\{5,7\\}, \\{6,6\\}, \\{6,9\\}, \\{7,5\\}, \\{7,8\\}, \\{8,7\\}, \\{9,6\\}, \\{9,9\\}.$$\n\nNext, let us choose 8 for the ones place.  The other two digits must be congruent to 1 mod 3, making a total of 8 pairs that satisfy that condition: $$\\{5,5\\}, \\{5,8\\}, \\{6,7\\}, \\{7,6\\}, \\{7,9\\}, \\{8,5\\}, \\{8,8\\}, \\{9,7\\}.$$\n\nThis makes a total of $\\boxed{16}$ numbers.",
