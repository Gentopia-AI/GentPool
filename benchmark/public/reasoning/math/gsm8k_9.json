    "problem": "A trader has 55 bags of rice in stock. She sells off some bags of rice and restocks 132 bags of rice. How many bags of rice did she sell if she now has 164 bags of rice?",
    "solution": "She had 55 bags and restocked 132 after selling some, so if she had not sold any, she would have a total of 55+132 = <<55+132=187>>187 bags\nHowever she now has 164 bags, so she must have sold off 187-164 = <<187-164=23>>23 bags\n#### 23",
