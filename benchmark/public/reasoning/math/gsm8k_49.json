    "problem": "Marj has two $20 bills, three $5 bills, and $4.50 in loose coins in her wallet. If she buys a cake that costs $17.50, how much money will be left in her wallet?",
    "solution": "Two $20 bills amount to $20 x 2 = $<<20*2=40>>40.\nThree $5 bills amount to $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.\nSo, Marj has $40 + $15 + $4.50 = $<<40+15+4.5=59.50>>59.50 in her wallet.\nIf she buys a cake, she will be left with $59.50 - $17.50 = $<<59.5-17.5=42>>42.\n#### 42",
