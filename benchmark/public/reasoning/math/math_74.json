    "problem": "Consider the set of points that are inside or within one unit of a rectangular parallelepiped (box) that measures $3$ by $4$ by $5$ units. Given that the volume of this set is $\\frac{m + n\\pi}{p},$ where $m, n,$ and $p$ are positive integers, and $n$ and $p$ are relatively prime, find $m + n + p.$\n",
    "solution": "[asy] size(220); import three; currentprojection = perspective(5,4,3); defaultpen(linetype(\"8 8\")+linewidth(0.6)); draw(box((0,-.1,0),(0.4,0.6,0.3))); draw(box((-.1,0,0),(0.5,0.5,0.3))); draw(box((0,0,-.1),(0.4,0.5,0.4))); draw(box((0,0,0),(0.4,0.5,0.3)),linewidth(1.2)+linetype(\"1\")); [/asy]\nThe set can be broken into several parts: the big $3\\times 4 \\times 5$ parallelepiped, $6$ external parallelepipeds that each share a face with the large parallelepiped and have a height of $1$, the $1/8$ spheres (one centered at each vertex of the large parallelepiped), and the $1/4$ cylinders connecting each adjacent pair of spheres.\nThe volume of the parallelepiped is $3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 60$ cubic units.\nThe volume of the external parallelepipeds is $2(3 \\times 4 \\times 1)+2(3 \\times 5 \\times 1 )+2(4 \\times 5 \\times 1)=94$.\nThere are $8$ of the $1/8$ spheres, each of radius $1$. Together, their volume is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.\nThere are $12$ of the $1/4$ cylinders, so $3$ complete cylinders can be formed. Their volumes are $3\\pi$, $4\\pi$, and $5\\pi$, adding up to $12\\pi$.\nThe combined volume of these parts is $60+94+\\frac{4}{3}\\pi+12\\pi = \\frac{462+40\\pi}{3}$. Thus, the answer is $m+n+p = 462+40+3 = \\boxed{505}$.",
