    "problem": "The Annual Interplanetary Mathematics Examination (AIME) is written by a committee of five Martians, five Venusians, and five Earthlings. At meetings, committee members sit at a round table with chairs numbered from $1$ to $15$ in clockwise order. Committee rules state that a Martian must occupy chair $1$ and an Earthling must occupy chair $15$, Furthermore, no Earthling can sit immediately to the left of a Martian, no Martian can sit immediately to the left of a Venusian, and no Venusian can sit immediately to the left of an Earthling. The number of possible seating arrangements for the committee is $N \\cdot (5!)^3$. Find $N$.\n",
    "solution": "Since the 5 members of each planet committee are distinct we get that the number of arrangement of sittings is in the form $N*(5!)^3$ because for each $M, V, E$ sequence we have $5!$ arrangements within the Ms, Vs, and Es.\nPretend the table only seats $3$ \"people\", with $1$ \"person\" from each planet. Counting clockwise, only the arrangement M, V, E satisfies the given constraints. Therefore, in the actual problem, the members must sit in cycles of M, V, E, but not necessarily with one M, one V, and one E in each cycle(for example, MMVVVE, MVVVEEE, MMMVVVEE all count as cycles). These cycles of MVE must start at seat $1$, since an M is at seat $1$. We simply count the number of arrangements through casework.\n1. The entire arrangement is one cycle- There is only one way to arrange this, MMMMMVVVVVEEEEE\n2. Two cycles - There are 3 Ms, Vs and Es left to distribute among the existing MVEMVE. Using stars and bars, we get $\\binom{4}{1}=4$ ways for the members of each planet. Therefore, there are $4^3=64$ ways in total.\n3. Three cycles - 2 Ms, Vs, Es left, so $\\binom{4}{2}=6$, making there $6^3=216$ ways total.\n4. Four cycles - 1 M, V, E left, each M can go to any of the four MVE cycles and likewise for V and E, $4^3=64$ ways total\n5. Five cycles - MVEMVEMVEMVEMVE is the only possibility, so there is just $1$ way.\nCombining all these cases, we get $1+1+64+64+216= \\boxed{346}$",
