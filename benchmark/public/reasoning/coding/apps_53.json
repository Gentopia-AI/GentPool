    "problem": "Consider packing widgets for shipping where widgets cannot be stacked upon each other (2D packing). Each widget has a $1\\times ~ l$ footprint and is $1$ unit high.\n\nBoxes are available in any $W$ by $H$ by $1$ size such that $H/2 \\leq W \\leq 2H$, with $W$ and $H$ being integers. The company wants to minimize the amount of packing material that will be needed to fill empty squares in a box.\n\nGiven $N$, the number of widgets to be shipped, what is the smallest number of squares that will be left empty when those widgets are packed for shipping?\n\n-----Input-----\nInput consists of one line containing an integer $N$, the number of widgets to be packed, where $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^{16}$.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint a single line containing an integer denoting the minimum number of empty squares.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n47\nSample Output 1:\n1\n\nSample Input 2:\n523\nSample Output 2:\n2",
