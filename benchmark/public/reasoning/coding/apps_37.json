    "problem": "Mirko’s ASCII street is made of $N$ lowercase letters of the English alphabet. The city government occasionally replaces the tiles in the street. However, the letter tiles are in high demand, so the government has only $M$ different tile patterns available.\n\nThe $i$th tile pattern consists of $L_ i$ letters. A tile cannot be rotated or broken into pieces, and it can only be placed such that the tile letters coincide with the contiguous letter subsequence in the street. Tiles can overlap and we can use multiple tiles of the same pattern.\n\nA street cell is untileable if it cannot be covered by any tile. Compute the number of untileable cells.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the positive integer $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 300000$), the length of the street.\n\nThe second line of input contains $N$ lowercase English letters, the letter sequence in the street.\n\nThe third line of input contains the positive integer $M$ ($1 \\le M \\le 5000$), the number of tile patterns.\n\nEach of the next $M$ lines contains a description of a tile pattern with length $L_ i$ ($1 \\le L_ i \\le 5000$). The tile pattern descriptions consist of lowercase English letters.\n\nThe total length of the tile patterns (the sum of the $L_ i$’s) is at most $13000000$.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain the required number of untileable cells.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n6\nabcbab\n2\ncb\ncbab\nSample Output 1:\n2\n\nSample Input 2:\n4\nabab\n2\nbac\nbaba\nSample Output 2:\n4",
