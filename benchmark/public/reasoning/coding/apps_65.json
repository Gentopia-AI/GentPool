    "problem": "Barr the Bear is playing the game Bits with Swanky Shen!\n\nBits is a very simple game. At the start, a circle of $N$ non-negative integers $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$, $\\ldots $, $A_ N$ is shown to both players. That is, to the left of the integer $A_ i$ is the integer $A_{i-1}$ if $i > 1$; and the integer $A_ N$ otherwise. To the right of the integer $A_ i$ is the integer $A_{i+1}$ if $i < N$; and the integer $A_1$ otherwise. Also an integer $K$ is given to both players.\n\nTo win this game, one must divide the circle of integers into exactly $K$ contiguous non-empty sections, such that the bitwise AND of the powers of all sections is maximized. The power of a contiguous section of integers is the bitwise OR of all integers in that section.\n\nBarr the Bear is lazy and knows that you are wise with bits. Hence, he has hired you to help him to win the game!\n\nNote: The binary bitwise operators OR and AND operate on the base-$2$ representation of the integers and correspond to the operators | and & respectively in C++ or Java.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains integers $N$ and $K$ ($1 \\leq K \\leq N \\leq 5\\cdot 10^5$), namely the number of integers and the number of contiguous non-empty sections required.\n\nThe next line contains $N$ integers, the $i^\\textrm {th}$ of which is the integer $A_ i$ ($0 \\leq A_ i \\leq 10^9$).\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer in one line: The maximum bitwise AND of the powers of the sections in an optimal division of the circle of integers.\n\n-----Explanation-----\nIn the first sample, the circle is $(2, 3, 4, 1)$. A possible division is $(3, 4)$ and $(1, 2)$. $(3, 4)$ has power $7$ and $(1, 2)$ has power $3$. The bitwise AND of $7$ and $3$ is $3$. Note that a section can possibly wrap around the circle.\n\nIn the second sample, a possible division is $(2, 2, 4)$, $(4)$, $(4, 2)$. The sectionsâ€™ powers are $6$, $4$ and $6$ respectively, which have bitwise AND of $4$. Note that we require the sections to be contiguous integers, so the division $(2, 4)$, $(2, 4)$, $(2, 4)$ is not permissible.\n\nIn the third sample, we can only have one section. This section will have all the integers, and thus have power $3$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4 2\n2 3 4 1\nSample Output 1:\n3\n\nSample Input 2:\n6 3\n2 2 2 4 4 4\nSample Output 2:\n4",
