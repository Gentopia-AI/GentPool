    "problem": "A network of size $N$ contains $N$ computers connected by $N-1$ cables, so that there is exactly $1$ path between any pair of computers.\n\nThe transmission cost between $2$ computers is equal to the square of the number of cables on the path connecting the $2$ computers.\n\nThe transmission cost of a network is equal to the sum of the transmission cost between all unordered pair of computers.\n\nGiven network $A$ with $N$ computers and network $B$ with $M$ computers, the administrator wants to create a new network $C$, by adding exactly one cable connecting one computer in $A$ and one computer in $B$.\n\nYour task is to minimize the transmission cost of the new network $C$.\n\n-----Input-----\n - The first line contains an integer $N$ - the number of computers in the network $A$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 50000$).\n - In the next $N-1$ lines, each line contains two distinct integers $u$ and $v$, representing a cable connecting computers $u$ and $v$ in network $A$ ($1 \\leq u,v \\leq N$).\n - The next line contains an integer $M$ - the number of computers in the network $B$ ($1 \\leq M \\leq 50000$).\n - In the next $M-1$ lines, each line contains two distinct integers $u$ and $v$, representing a cable connecting computers $u$ and $v$ in network $B$ ($1 \\leq u,v \\leq M$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that each network is a tree.\n\n-----Output-----\nWrite in one line the minimum transmission cost of the resulting network $C$.\n\n-----Sample clarification-----\nIn the first sample below, connecting computer $2$ of network $A$ and computer $1$ of network $B$ will minimize the transmission cost of the network.\n\nIn the second sample below, connecting computer $4$ of network $A$ and computer $1$ of network $B$ will minimize the transmission cost of the network.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n4\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\nSample Output:\n96",
