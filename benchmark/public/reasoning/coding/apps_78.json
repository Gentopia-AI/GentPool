    "problem": "Many airports have moving conveyor belts in the corridors between halls and terminals. Instead of walking on the floor, passengers can choose to stand on a conveyor or, even better, walk on a conveyor to get to the end of the corridor much faster.\n\nThe brand new Delft City Airport uses a similar system. However, in line with the latest fashion in airport architecture, there are no corridors: the entire airport is one big hall with a bunch of conveyor lines laid out on the floor arbitrarily.\n\nTo get from a certain point $A$ to a certain point $B$, a passenger can use any combination of walking on the floor and walking on conveyors. Passengers can hop on or off a conveyor at any point along the conveyor. It is also possible to cross a conveyor without actually standing on it.\n\nWalking on the floor goes at a speed of $1$ meter/second.\n\n Walking forward on a conveyor goes at a total speed of $2$ meter/second.\n\n Walking in reverse direction on a conveyor is useless and illegal, but you may walk on the floor immediately next to the conveyor. (Conveyors are infinitely thin.)\n\nHow fast can you get from $A$ to $B$?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains four floating point numbers, $X_ A$, $Y_ A$, $X_ B$, and $Y_ B$. They describe the coordinates of your initial location $A = (X_ A,Y_ A)$ and your final location $B = (X_ B,Y_ B)$.\n\nThe second line contains an integer $N$, the number of conveyors in the hall ($0 \\leq N \\leq 100$). The following $N$ lines each contain four floating point numbers, $X_1$, $Y_1$, $X_2$, and $Y_2$, describing a conveyor which starts at the point $(X_1,Y_1)$ and ends at the point $(X_2,Y_2)$, running in a straight line from start to end.\n\nAll coordinates are floating point numbers in the range ($0 \\leq X, Y \\leq 1000.0$), expressed in units of meters, given with at most $6$ decimals after the decimal point.\n\nConveyors are at least $1$ meter long. Conveyors do not intersect or touch. Your start and destination are not on any conveyor.\n\n-----Output-----\nWrite one line with a floating point number, the minimum time (in seconds) needed to get from $A$ to $B$ in seconds.\n\nYour answer may have an absolute error of at most $10^{-4}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n60.0 0.0 50.0 170.0\n3\n40.0 0.0 0.0 0.0\n5.0 20.0 5.0 170.0\n95.0 0.0 95.0 80.0\nSample Output 1:\n168.7916512460\n\nSample Input 2:\n60.0 0.0 50.0 170.0\n3\n40.0 0.0 0.0 0.0\n5.0 20.0 5.0 170.0\n95.0 0.0 95.0 100.0\nSample Output 2:\n163.5274740179\n\nSample Input 3:\n0.0 1.0 4.0 1.0\n1\n0.0 0.0 4.0 0.0\nSample Output 3:\n3.7320508076",
