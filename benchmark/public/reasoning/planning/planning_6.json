A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the white block is clear, the magenta block is clear, the black block is clear, the cyan block is clear, the green block is clear, the violet block is clear, the silver block is clear, the gold block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on the table, the blue block is on the table, the orange block is on the table, the yellow block is on the table, the white block is on the table, the magenta block is on the table, the black block is on the table, the cyan block is on the table, the green block is on the table, the violet block is on the table, the silver block is on the table and the gold block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the white block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the cyan block, the white block is on top of the green block, the magenta block is on top of the black block, the black block is on top of the red block, the cyan block is on top of the silver block, the green block is on top of the gold block, the violet block is on top of the blue block and the silver block is on top of the violet block.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\npick up the green block\nstack the green block on top of the gold block\npick up the white block\nstack the white block on top of the green block\npick up the blue block\nstack the blue block on top of the white block\npick up the violet block\nstack the violet block on top of the blue block\npick up the silver block\nstack the silver block on top of the violet block\npick up the cyan block\nstack the cyan block on top of the silver block\npick up the yellow block\nstack the yellow block on top of the cyan block\npick up the orange block\nstack the orange block on top of the yellow block\npick up the red block\nstack the red block on top of the orange block\npick up the black block\nstack the black block on top of the red block\npick up the magenta block\nstack the magenta block on top of the black block\n[PLAN END]\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the white block is clear, the magenta block is clear, the cyan block is clear, the silver block is clear, the gold block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on the table, the blue block is on the table, the white block is on the table, the magenta block is on the table, the cyan block is on the table, the silver block is on the table and the gold block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the red block is on top of the cyan block, the white block is on top of the gold block, the magenta block is on top of the silver block, the cyan block is on top of the magenta block, the silver block is on top of the white block and the gold block is on top of the blue block.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",
