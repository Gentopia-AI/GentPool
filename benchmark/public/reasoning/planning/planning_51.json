A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\nunstack the red block from on top of the yellow block\nput down the red block\nunstack the blue block from on top of the orange block\nstack the blue block on top of the red block\npick up the yellow block\nstack the yellow block on top of the orange block\n[PLAN END]\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",
