    "problem": "I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do\n\nAttack object. It takes 1 minute to do the Attack action.\nFeast object from another object. It takes 1 minute to do the Feast action.\nSuccumb object. It takes 1 minute to do the Succumb action.\nOvercome object from another object. It takes 1 minute to do the Overcome action.\n\nI have the following restrictions on my actions:\nTo perform Attack action, the following facts need to be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.\nOnce Attack action is performed the following facts will be true: Pain object.\nOnce Attack action is performed the following facts will be false: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.\nTo perform Succumb action, the following facts need to be true: Pain object.\nOnce Succumb action is performed the following facts will be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.    \nOnce Succumb action is performed the following facts will be false: Pain object.\nTo perform Overcome action, the following needs to be true: Province other object, Pain object.\nOnce Overcome action is performed the following will be true: Harmony, Pain object, Object Craves other object.\nOnce Overcome action is performed the following will be false: Province other object, Pain object.\nTo perform Feast action, the following needs to be true: Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.\nOnce Feast action is performed the following will be true: Pain object, Province other object.\nOnce Feast action is performed the following will be false:, Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, object c craves object a, object d craves object c, harmony, planet object a, planet object b, province object b and province object d.\nMy goal is to have that object a craves object d and object c craves object a. I want to minimize the time taken to achieve my goal.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\nfeast object d from object c\nsuccumb object d\nfeast object c from object a\novercome object c from object b\nattack object a\novercome object a from object d\nfeast object c from object b\novercome object c from object a\n[PLAN END]\nThe total time to execute the plan is 8 minutes.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, object a craves object d, object b craves object c, object c craves object a, harmony, planet object d and province object b.\nMy goal is to have that object b craves object c and object d craves object b.
