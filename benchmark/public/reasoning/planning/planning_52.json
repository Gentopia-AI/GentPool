    "problem": "I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do:\n\nPick up a block. It takes 1 minute to pick up a block.\nUnstack a block from on top of another block. It takes 1 minute to unstack a block from on top of another block.\nPut down a block. It takes 1 minute to put down a block.\nStack a block on top of another block. It takes 1 minute to stack a block on top of another block.\n\nI have the following restrictions on my actions:\nI can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.\nI can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.\nI can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table, the blue block is on the table and the white block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the white block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.
