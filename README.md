# GentPool
The pool of Agents for Gentopia

## Install Gentopia
Currently, we haven't registered Gentopia to pip. Fork and clone [Gentopia](https://github.com/Gentopia-AI/Gentopia) and install locally.
```
pip install Gentopia
```

## Register Keys in dotenv
Create a `.env` file in project directory, write into the keys you might use:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY= xxxx
WOLFRAM_ALPHA_APPID= xxxx
```

## Register an empty new agent under ./pool/
```
./create_agent <your_agent_name> 
```

## Assemble your agent
After specializing your agent (prompt tuning, tool tuning, SFT on LMs, etc.), simply assemble your agent by 
```
python assemble.py <your_agent_name>
```
